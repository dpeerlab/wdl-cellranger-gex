WDLized Cell Ranger Gene Expression Pipeline

## License

The pipeline code is available to everyone under the standard [MIT license](./LICENSE). However, the pipeline internally uses 10x software, so please make sure that you read and agree to [10x End User Software License](https://www.10xgenomics.com/end-user-software-license-agreement).

## Setup

The pipeline is a part of SCING (Single-Cell pIpeliNe Garden; pronounced as "sing" /si≈ã/). For setup, please refer to [this page](https://github.com/hisplan/scing). All the instructions below is given under the assumption that you have already configured SCING in your environment.

## Create Job Files

You need two files for processing a GEX sample - one inputs file and one labels file. Use the following example files to help you create your configuration file:

- `configs/template.inputs.json`
- `configs/template.labels.json`

### Reference

Use one of the URLs below for the reference genome:
